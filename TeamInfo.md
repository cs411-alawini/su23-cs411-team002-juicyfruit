## Project Summary

Our project aims to create an account based website that users can use to find game suggestions based on their interests. The user can find games based on genre, multiplayer compatibility, price, as well as other features, and they can add the games they play into their own personalized list. There will also be an option to connect users based on their shared interests and show which games that they both play, or might enjoy playing together. The user will also be able to filter based on the platform they want to play the game in, since some games are available only on PC, whereas some games are available only on a console. As the database contains many thousands of games and a huge variety of genres to filter from, users will undoubtedly be able to find games that they will enjoy playing.
