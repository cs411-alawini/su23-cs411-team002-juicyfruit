FROM Games g JOIN Reviews r ON (g.GameId = r.GameId)
GROUP BY g.GameName, MetacriticRating
HAVING AvgScore > 0.5
ORDER BY g.GameName
LIMIT 15;
```

## Query 2 

```sql

FROM Games g JOIN Reviews r ON (g.GameId = r.GameId)
WHERE  CategorySinglePlayer = 1 AND g.Price < 20.0
GROUP BY g.GameName, g.Price
HAVING AvgScore > 0.5)

UNION

# Index Analysis 

## Query 1:

Default Index: The costs are relativly high with the nested inner loop join having a cost of 207878, table scan having a cost of 2414, and index lookup having a cost of 12.56. These costs could mean that the query is using a lot of resources to get what is needed.
<img src="./images/Query1ExplainNoIDX.png"> 

We added an index on gameName, but found no difference in the cost. We chose gameName because it was one of the attributes that didn't have a pointer to it. 
<img src="./images/Query1NameIDX.png"> 

Index on metacritic rating also had no change on cost. We chose to index on metacritic as well since it was in out select cause without a pointer pointing to it, but it makes sense it had no impact on the cost since we are simply printing the critics.
<img src="./images/Query1metaidx.png"> 

reviewScore index no change in cost. We decided to index this because the aggregate function would be using this attribute to calculate a value for a specific game, yet it still did not change cost.
<img src="./images/Query1ReviewScoreIDX.png"> 

Overall, we did not find any significant change in cost even though we tried indexing 3 different attributes. We believe it is because weâ€™re using an aggregate function and we are using the primary key to join tables which forces the compiler to go through a full table scan no matter what. Another possibility could be that the indexes weren't properly forming, however, we do not believe that is the case since a change was found on query #2. Due to this, we deicded to not use any indexing for this query as it did not change the cost associated with it.


## Query 2
Default Index: 
<img src="./images/Query2NoIDX.png">  

Creating index for categoryMultiplayer changed cost from 2048 to 393.11. 
<img src="./images/Query2Multidx.png"> 

Index for single player also decreased cost 665.51 from 2048.
<img src="./images/Query2SingleIDX.png"> 

The price index deceased the cost for nested loop inner join from 22k to 823.
